# RaysJS
JS Projects Heaped into a central location. Some of these were written by me, or by A.I. with my input and direction.

Dependencies are in the JS folder and its subfolders.
Dependencies are not covered by the License, only the main code for the various projects in the other folders. Please look for the licenses for the dependencies seperately.
